  strStoryText: "The morning sun grazes your face, as the distant but yet quite close
    sound of your alarm going off.\r\nThen, reality hits you, it's 7:25 AM. \r\nWork
    starts in 35 minutes and surely, you can make it.\r\n\r\nUnless you just choose
    not to head into work.\r\nWhat will you do?\r\n1 - Stay in Bed.\r\n2 - Wake up,
    get up, get out there."
