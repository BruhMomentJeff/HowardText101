The morning sun grazes your face, as the distant but yet quite close sound of your alarm going off.
Then, reality hits you, it's 7:25 AM. 
Work starts in 35 minutes and surely, you can make it.

Unless you just choose not to head into work.
What will you do?
1 - Stay in Bed.
2 - Wake up, get up, get out there.
