  strStoryText: 'You can''t just give up, focused and clear minded, you

    decide
    once more, turning the key into the ignition and

    with the whir and roar
    of the engine, you got it, your car

    starts up and you''re able to head
    to work.

    However, an issue arises when the usual route to work is

    having
    construction done, and while they made a steady

    path through, it''s clogged
    up with other cars.

    What do you do?

    -Wait in the traffic, maybe it
    won''t take too long. (1)

    -Try to find another route to work. (2)'
